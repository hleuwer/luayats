<h1><a name="kernel" id="luagraph"></a>Simulation Kernel&nbsp;</h1>The Luayats simulation environment consists of the following core components:<br /><ul><li>Simulator object&nbsp;<a href="lua/files/yats/core.html#sim:connect">yats.sim</a> with the calendar queue</li><li>Network
objects, that implement the actual functionality by sending and
receiving data items from other objects and scheduling events into the
calendar queue.&nbsp;</li><li>Connection management to connect the network objects to a network</li><li>Data handling for sending and receiving data items.</li></ul><h3><a name="phases"></a>Simulation Phases</h3>A simulation runs in three phases<br /><ul><li>Declaration phase: Initialization of simulator and instantiation of network objects</li><li>Connection phase: Connects network objects to a consistent netlist</li><li>Execution phase: Runs the simulation by scheduling events and data item exchange between network objects.</li></ul><h3><a name="calendar"></a>Calendar Queue</h3>Central&nbsp;part
of the simulation kernel is the&nbsp;calendar queue, which operates on
events created and scheduled by network objects. Events are queued in
the calendar queue according to their scheduled due time using the
methods<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">alarme(event, time)</span> or <span style="font-family: monospace;">eache(event, time)</span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">alarml(event, time<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">) or </span><span style="font-family: monospace;">eachl(event, time)</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">.</span></span></p><p>Once
the internal timeslot counter reaches the scheduling time of an event,
the event fires: single shot events are&nbsp;removed from the calendar,
cyclic events are automatically re-scheduled before the event handler
is called.and one of the following net objects methods is called<span style="font-family: monospace;">.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp; &nbsp;early(event)</span> or <span style="font-family: monospace;"><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;late(event)<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">.</span></span></p><p>A single shot event can also be manually&nbsp;re-scheduled in the event handler to become a cyclical event.</p><p>The timeslot counter advances when all events have been processed.</p><p>Luayats splits a timetick into 2 different phases:</p><ul><li>The EARLY phase is the phase where net objects transfer data</li><li>The LATE phase is the phase where houskeeping function are executed, e.g. scheduling algorithms.</li></ul><p>Corresponding
to the timeslot phases, events scheduled with <span style="font-family: monospace;">alarme(event, time)</span> fire
in the EARLY timeslot phase and events scheduled with <span style="font-family: monospace;">alarml(event,
time)</span> fire in the LATE timeslot phase.&nbsp;</p><h2><a name="netobjects"></a>Network Objects</h2>Network objects are instances of network classes. Each network object implements at least the following mandatory&nbsp; methods:<br /><br /><table style="text-align: left; width: 657px;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td style="font-family: monospace; width: 238px;">early(event)</td><td style="width: 399px;">Called by the calendar queue when an early event fires</td></tr><tr><td style="font-family: monospace; width: 238px;">late(event)</td><td style="width: 399px;">Called by the calendar queue when a late event fires</td></tr><tr><td style="font-family: monospace; width: 238px;">handle(inputname, successor)</td><td style="width: 399px;">Called
by an network object during connect() to establish the connection to
it's successor. The function returns a handle to be used during sending
data items with <span style="font-family: monospace;">rec(data, handle)</span></td></tr><tr><td style="font-family: monospace; width: 238px;">connect()</td><td style="width: 399px;">Called by the simulation kernel for all network objects during the connection phase.&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td style="font-family: monospace; width: 238px;">rec(data, ihandle)</td><td style="width: 399px;">Called by a network object to send data to it's successor</td></tr><tr><td style="font-family: monospace; width: 238px;"></td><td style="width: 399px;"></td></tr></tbody></table><br />Normally
network objects are dynamically instantiated via Lua in the simulation
control script. All network classes are automatically made visible to
Lua during&nbsp; compilation&nbsp; using the tool tolua++.<br /><h5><a name="classhierarchy"></a>Class Hierarchy</h5><p>Luayats
has a built-in scheme for object oriented programming. &nbsp;Each
network object class has a C++ and a Lua representative.<br />The Hierarchy and the relation between the C++ universe and the Lua universe is shown in the figure below.</p><p><img style="width: 718px; height: 723px;" alt="" src="classtree.png" /></p><p>The scheme provides the following features:</p><ul><li>Methods and members of the C++ objects are visible to Lua scripts</li><li>Lua scripts can override C++ methods and members</li><li>Lua scripts can extend objects with members and methods both at during class declaration and during runtime.</li><li>Lua scripts have full access to both,&nbsp; the Lua and the C++ inheritance chain.</li><li>The
user can declare new network objects in Lua using either a Lua or a C++
defined class as base class. This is especially useful for rapid
prototyping of new network models without the need to compile.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>During
class definition using <span style="font-family: monospace;">newclass = class(baseclass)</span> the original proxy table created by tolua++ is renamed
and a new class is defined using the original one as base class. In
order to simplify object initialization most of the constructor work is
done using Lua in the&nbsp;constructor function <span style="font-family: monospace;">init(params)</span> of the new class. When a
class instance (object) is created the methods of the base class
are copied into the newly created object.&nbsp;</p><p>The C++ object is
created as userdata. which is stored in the Lua registry and set as
metatable for the new proxy table.</p><p>The class hierarchy is as follows:</p><p style="font-weight: bold;">_BASE</p><dl><dd>This is the immediate base class (old proxy class) created by tolua++.</dd></dl><dl style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><dt>root</dt></dl><dl><dd>Builds
the lowest level in the class hierarchy and&nbsp;provides basically
virtual methods. &nbsp;The class is extended with additional methods.</dd></dl><dl><dt style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">ino</dt><dd>Provides generic methods to each network object, also called node.</dd></dl><p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">in1out, inxout &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><dl><dd>Base class for network object with multiple inputs and one or multiple outputs</dd><dt></dt></dl><p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="constructors"></a>Constructors and destructors</span></p><p>The
C++ constructor&nbsp;typically restricts it's work to the absolute
minimum and to those initializations, that cannot be performed in
Lua.&nbsp;Most
of the initialization is performed by the Lua constructor function <span style="font-family: monospace;">CLASS.init(param)</span>, which receives a parameter table with named&nbsp;parameters, which can be defined in arbitrary order.&nbsp;</p><p>The
Lua constructor also defines the objects inputs and output and
registers events with the simulation calendar, if required. It finally
calls the Lua function <span style="font-family: monospace;">self:finish()</span>, which finalizes the object
construction by calling the C++ baseclass's member function&nbsp;<span style="font-family: monospace;">act()</span>.</p><p>Network
objects are automatically deleted via Lua garbage collection. The C++
destructor is called automatically when the Lua object is collected.</p><p>However,
Luayats does not collect network objects directly when the simulation
end. The objects are collected temporarily in hidden table for post
mortem debugging purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2><a name="datatypes"></a>Data Objects</h2><p>Luayats
provides a couple of data item classes. Data items are crated,&nbsp;
sent and deleted between network objects. The creation often occurs in
sources while the deletion occurs in the sink network object.</p><p>The most important data types are</p><dl style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><dt>cell</dt></dl><dl><dd>ATM cell for direct usage or as base class for other datatypes.&nbsp;</dd></dl><p style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">frame</p><dl><dd>Generic frame, which has a number of different frame discriminators.</dd></dl><p>There exist also a number of derived data item types. See src/kernel/data.h for more details.</p><p>Data
objects are not actually deleted upon their deconstruction. The are
merely stored in pools for later reuse. This speeds up the allocation
of data items a lot. The pool grows as allocation of data items grow.
It never shrinks. This mechanism is implemented by overloading the data types new and delete methods.</p><p style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</p><p>When
using Lua defined network objects, there exists a possible race
condition in conjunction with the interworking between the C++
&nbsp;and the Lua universe. Generally a data item created via Lua is
subject to Lua's garbage collection. If the data item has been sent
into a queue residing in the C++ universe it is invisible to Lua and
Lua may collect this object.</p><p>It is therefore recommended to keep
a reference to such items within the Lua universe until the item is not
needed any longer in order to avoid the data item to be collected by
Lua.</p><h2><a name="create"></a>Creating Network Object Classes</h2><h3>Creating net objects with C++</h3><p>This is the standard way to create high performance network object classes. The following steps are required:</p><ul><li>Define the network object class in a header file</li><li>Define the required minimum set of methods, like rec(), early(), late() and so on.</li><li>Mark the methods and members to be wrapped to Lua using the //tolua_begin //tolua_end and //tolua_export directives.</li><li>Include the header file into the file src/lua/yats.pkg</li><li>Write the Lua defined base class which implements the Lua constructor <span style="font-family: monospace;">init(params)</span></li><li>Compile Luayats<span style="font-family: monospace;"><br /></span></li></ul><span style="font-family: monospace;"></span><p>Most of the standard Luayats network object classes are defined in this way.</p><h3>Creating net objects with Lua</h3><p>For
rapid prototyping it is convenient and often sufficient from a speed
point of view to invent new network object classes without any C++ knowledge and&nbsp;recompilation. Follow the following steps:</p><ul><li>Define a Lua define base class using <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">lua1out</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">luaxout</span></li><ul><li>These<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>classes
are predefined and can be used like any other C++ base class. They are
the Lua equivalent to in1out and inxout for C++ based network object
classes.</li></ul><li>Define the required methods <span style="font-weight: bold;">l</span><span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">uarec()</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">luaearly()</span> and <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">lualate()</span></li></ul><p>The
Lua defined net object class can be used like any other network object
class. It performs a lot slower because event handlers and data
receiving function are implemented in Lua. However, depending on what
you want to simulate, Lua's high performance allows you do valuable
simulations using this method.</p><p>See the file <a href="../yats/dummy.lua">yats/dummy.lua</a> for an example.</p><h2><a name="assembly"></a>Assembling Network Object Classes</h2><p>Luayats provides ways to build new network object classes from already availabe classes. </p><h3>Assembling net objects with C++</h3><p>It
is possible to use already avalable&nbsp;C++ network object classes
within the definition of a new one. Since this method of assembling new
classes is very flexible, no generic rules can be given here. However ,
the class ethbridge is an example, which defines new functionality for
ethernet frame classification and forwarding and uses the already
available frame base priority multiplexer muxFrmPrio for it's output
queuing. The multiplexers are instantiated in the Lua level constructor
<span style="font-family: monospace;">ethbridge:init(params).&nbsp;</span></p><p>Two additional steps have to be undertaken:</p><ul><li>Since
we use embedded multiplexers&nbsp;at the outputs, we have to ensure
that their connect() function is called to establish a proper netlist
for Luayats. This is done by overloading the network object's (here
ethbridge) connect function and &nbsp;call the corresponding connect()
functions of the multiplexers. At the inputs the handle() function of
the ethbridge class is used. </li><li>Ensure internal connectivity by
calling the multiplexers rec() function directly from an ethbridge
method, here: ethbridge:rec().</li></ul><h3>Assembling net objects with Lua block structure</h3><p>Luayats
provides a generic mechanism to construct block structures using
available network object classes without touching C++ code.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a generic net object class <span style="font-weight: bold;">block</span>
that acts as a container for arbitrary subnetlists, even in multiple
levels. The class block has the same methods as the class root to help
in network object class definition.</p><p>See the file <a href="../yats/switch.lua">yats/switch.lua</a> for examples.</p><h2><a name="connect"></a>Connecting Instances</h2><p>Instances
of network object classes need to be connected. During node
instantiation the successor nodes and their inputs are given as
parameter out using the successor node's name (text) and it's input pin
names. Luayats resolves the netlist automatically by calling the <span style="font-family: monospace;">connect()</span> method of all defined network objects. This is done in the Lua control script via <span style="font-family: monospace;">sim:connect()</span>. The objects will then call their successors <span style="font-family: monospace;">handle()</span>
method to receive a handle for the corresponding input of the
successor. This handle is then used when sending data items to a
successor node.</p><p>Luayats detects unconnected pins and raises an appropriate error.</p></div>
